# Growth Hackers App

- [x] list 1 API source products
- [ ] list 2 or more distinct API source products
- [x] User can add items as favorites
- [x] Favorites persist after page load (on login)
- [x] Add and remove items from favorites
- [ ] Sort items by attributes
- [ ] Search items by attributes

## As a visitor:

- [x] I can see all API sources data; 
- [ ] I can change the API source; 
- [x] I can view the list of items; 
- [x] I can create an account, login, and logout. 

## As a logged user: 
- [x] I can add and remove items from favorites; 
- [x] I can list all my favorites independent of the source.

## On favorites page: 
- [x] Once logged I can add items to my favorites and see the favorites page; 
- [x] The favorites page must list all my items independent of the source, 
- [ ] The search and ordering are dynamic on this page, they will appear depending on the items that I have on my list. 
- [ ] The search must be a click to enable field type. 
    
## Requirements: 
- [x] The APIs can be in REST or GraphQL. You can find some here http://apis.guru/graphql-apis/ 
- Apollo GraphQL or Axios can be used; 
- [ ] Tests must use Jest. Enzyme or React Testing Library can be used as support lib; 
- [x] Any users and favorites can be stored in the local storage. The use of a "GraphQL as a service" or a "Crud ready service" to store and retrieve the data is a plus; 
- Can be used Bootstrap Framework or Ant Design for styles, but Ant is preferred; 
- If any React boilerplate structure is used, it is expected that the "not used features" and not used files be removed (no useless code or files). 
- All good practices, code structure and latest features of React will be required (https://reactjs.org/); 
- Is expected a good README from a shared project; 

## Final considerations:

Thank you GrowthHackers for the opportunity, it was a difficult task considering my basic knowledge of React.
I'm aware that i haven't met the requirements, to make it easier for the reviewer i made a small checklist of which requirements i have met, keep in mind that i changed the text in some requirements to better reflect what i achieved, i also commented the code with explanations of how the code works.
Thanks again and i hope i might be able to do another challenge when im more experienced.
